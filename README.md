This repository demonstrates a subtle yet potentially problematic HTML bug involving the use of innerHTML.  The bug arises when attempting to modify the innerHTML property of an element that might not exist yet when the script runs. This is more likely to occur when the HTML structure is complex or dynamically generated.  The solution offers a safer method using a check before modifying innerHTML to prevent runtime errors.
